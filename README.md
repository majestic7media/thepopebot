# thepopebot

**Autonomous AI agents. All the power. None of the leaked API keys.**

---

## Why thepopebot?

**Secure by default** — Other frameworks hand credentials to the LLM and hope for the best. thepopebot is different: the AI literally cannot access your secrets, even if it tries. Secrets are filtered at the process level before the agent's shell even starts.

**The repository IS the agent** — Every action your agent takes is a git commit. You can see exactly what it did, when, and why. If it screws up, revert it. Want to clone your agent? Fork the repo — code, personality, scheduled jobs, full history, all of it goes with your fork.

**Free compute, built in** — Every GitHub account comes with free cloud computing time. thepopebot uses that to run your agent. One task or a hundred in parallel — the compute is already included.

**Self-evolving** — The agent modifies its own code through pull requests. Every change is auditable, every change is reversible. You stay in control.

You interact with your bot via the web chat interface or Telegram (optional). The Event Handler creates a job branch. GitHub Actions spins up a Docker container with the Pi coding agent. The agent does the work, commits the results, and opens a PR. Auto-merge handles the rest. You get a notification when it's done.

## Get FREE server time on Github!

| | thepopebot | Other platforms |
|---|---|---|
| **Public repos** | Free. $0. GitHub Actions doesn't charge. | $20-100+/month |
| **Private repos** | 2,000 free minutes/month (every GitHub plan, including free) | $20-100+/month |
| **Infrastructure** | GitHub Actions (already included) | Dedicated servers |

You just bring your own [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/).

## Get Started

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Install |
|-------------|---------|
| **Node.js 18+** | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) |
| **npm** | Included with Node.js |
| **Git** | [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com) |
| **GitHub CLI** | [cli.github.com](https://cli.github.com) |
| **Docker + Docker Compose** | [docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) |
| **ngrok*** | [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/download) |

*\*ngrok is only required for local installs without port forwarding. VPS/cloud deployments don't need it.*

### Three steps

**Step 1** — Scaffold a new project:

```bash
mkdir my-agent && cd my-agent
npx thepopebot init
```

This creates a Next.js project with configuration files, GitHub Actions workflows, and agent templates. You don't need to create a GitHub repo first — the setup wizard handles that.

**Step 2** — Run the setup wizard:

```bash
npm run setup
```

The wizard walks you through everything:
- Checks prerequisites (Node.js, Git, GitHub CLI)
- Creates a GitHub repository and pushes your initial commit
- Creates a GitHub Personal Access Token (scoped to your repo)
- Collects API keys (Anthropic required; OpenAI, Brave optional)
- Sets GitHub repository secrets and variables
- Generates `.env`
- Builds the project

**Step 3** — Start your agent:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

- **Web Chat**: Visit your APP_URL to chat with your agent, create jobs, upload files
- **Telegram** (optional): Run `npm run setup-telegram` to connect a Telegram bot
- **Webhook**: Send a POST to `/api/create-job` with your API key to create jobs programmatically
- **Cron**: Edit `config/CRONS.json` to schedule recurring jobs

> **Local installs**: Your server needs to be reachable from the internet for GitHub webhooks and Telegram. On a VPS/cloud server, your APP_URL is just your domain. For local development, use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) (`ngrok http 80`) or port forwarding to expose your machine. If your ngrok URL changes, update APP_URL in `.env` and the GitHub repository variable, and re-run `npm run setup-telegram` if Telegram is configured.

## CLI Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npx thepopebot init` | Scaffold a new project, or check for updated templates in an existing one |
| `npx thepopebot diff [file]` | List files that differ from package templates, or show the diff for a specific file |
| `npx thepopebot reset [file]` | List all template files, or restore a specific file (or directory) to the package default |
| `npm run setup` | Run the full interactive setup wizard |
| `npm run setup-telegram` | Reconfigure the Telegram webhook (useful when your ngrok URL changes) |

---

## Updating

When thepopebot is updated via npm, your customizations are always preserved — template changes are never applied automatically. To update:

```bash
npm update thepopebot
npx thepopebot init
```

`init` will report which templates have drifted (new files are created automatically, existing files are never overwritten):

```
Updated templates available:
These files differ from the current package templates.

  config/CRONS.json
  .github/workflows/run-job.yml

To view differences:  npx thepopebot diff <file>
To reset to default:  npx thepopebot reset <file>
```

Review and accept changes at your own pace:

```bash
npx thepopebot diff config/CRONS.json    # see what changed
npx thepopebot reset config/CRONS.json   # accept the new template
```

Or manually merge the changes if you want to keep some of your edits.

After updating, restart Docker to pick up new image versions:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
